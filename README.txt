This is the first website I created, very basic.

The aim was to create a responsive website so that it would look good on all platforms.

Used Flexbox for the 4 articles just to get some practice with it.

Used jQuery to Hide/Show the sidebar based on the viewport size, again, just to get some practice with it.

Used Photoshop for the sidebar icons and to overlay "Unflattering Images of Animals" on top of the Owl pic.
